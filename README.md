# Analysis 
Summary Report: Youth Smoking and Drug Dataset ðŸš­ðŸ’ŠÂ¶
This notebook explores the trends and influencing factors behind youth smoking and drug experimentation from 2020-2024. Key insights include:

Age Group: Substance use peaks in the 20-25 age group, with declining trends after 30.
Gender: Males show a higher prevalence of smoking, while drug experimentation is more evenly distributed.
Socioeconomic Status: Youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds have higher substance use rates.
Family Influence: Lack of parental supervision correlates with increased smoking and drug experimentation.
Mental Health: Youths with poor mental health exhibit significantly higher substance use.
Machine Learning: Predictive models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) identified family background and mental health as the strongest predictors of substance use.
This analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers to target interventions more effectively.
